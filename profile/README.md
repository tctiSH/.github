# tctiSH
Inspired by [iSH](https://github.com/ish-app/ish) and [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/utm), tctiSH is a lightweight full Linux runtime for iOS, iPadOS, and maybe one day watchOS. Built on top of [qemu-tcti](https://github.com/tctiSH/qemu), it has the ability to run x86_64 Linux programs using the TCTI pseudo-JIT.

> ### ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️
> This doesn't yet properly work. It is _highly_ experimental, and any use is at your own risk. Unless it _does_ work, in which case we've not updated the readme yet.

This organisation contains the primary repository for [tctiSH](https://github.com/tctiSH/tctiSH), as well as the forks that support its development. We do not recommend use of any of these forks outside tctiSH.
